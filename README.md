This project was inspired by [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rareinsults/comments/ouunck/i_wont_allow_students_to_use_gay_as_an_insult_so/) by [u/gross_cleanthatup](https://www.reddit.com/user/gross_cleanthatup/). I've created it to learn React + Typescript and also to have fun making something silly.
